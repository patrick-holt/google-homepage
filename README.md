This project is a copy of the Google homepage. It is meant to show off my skill in HTML and CSS.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Notes from finishing:
Having the pages (real and mine) side by side made me realise that I am off with the margins in several places. But when it comes to the the structure, both of the page but of the code as well, I think I did alright. Another times I should rely a bit more in `<div>` tags to structure the HTML. There is still some uncertainty as to when I should use ID's or Classes. May also have gotten a bit too specific with some selectors in the CSS, but I had difficulties getting some declarations to apply.
